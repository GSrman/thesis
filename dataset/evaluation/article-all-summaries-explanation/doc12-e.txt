**Ethical Aspects Summary:**

- Bias and Fairness: The research does not explicitly discuss bias or fairness, but evaluating
Tree-LSTM models on diverse datasets could mitigate potential biases.

- Privacy: No information provided about privacy concerns in the paper.

- Transparency: While tree structures are described to improve transparency over linear chains,
no direct discussion of model interpretability or transparency is made.
 Writes on Dual Use: The paper does not address potential dual uses of the Tree-LSTM models.

- Accessibility: No mention of accessibility issues in terms of making the technology available
to a broader audience or ensuring its fair application across different demographics.

- Data Collection: As with previous RNNs, it is implied that ethical data collection practices
were likely followed during model training and evaluation; however, specific details are not
provided within this abstract.
