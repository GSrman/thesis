**Bias and Fairness: Not explicitly addressed in the provided research paper segment.**

**Privacy: No explicit mention or discussion on privacy considerations within the research paper
segment.**

**Transparency: The model's decisions are based on a neural network, but there is no detailed
explanation of its internal workings or how it translates between languages in this summary.
Qualitative analysis indicates plausible alignments, suggesting some level of transparency
regarding the linguistic relevance of predictions.**

**Dual Use: Not discussed directly within the research paper segment provided; however, neural
machine translation systems can be applied to both beneficial and potentially harmful purposes
(e.g., language understanding in medical or military applications).**

**Accessibility: No explicit mention of how this model could impact accessibility for non-native
speakers or individuals with disabilities within the research paper segment provided.**

**Data Collection: The methodology includes training on a corpus, but specifics about data
collection are not discussed in detail. The use of phrase-based systems and neural machine
translation suggests an extensive dataset would be required to achieve comparable performance
levels.**
