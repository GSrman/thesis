Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model called RNN Encoder–
Decoder that consists of two recurrent
neural networks (RNN). One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixedlength vector representation, and the other
decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly
trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source
sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder–Decoder as an
additional feature in the existing log-linear
model. Qualitatively, we show that the
proposed model learns a semantically and
syntactically meaningful representation of
linguistic phrases.
Introduction
Deep neural networks have shown great success in
various applications such as objection recognition
(see, e.g., (Krizhevsky et al., 2012)) and speech
recognition (see, e.g., (Dahl et al., 2012)). Furthermore, many recent works showed that neural networks can be successfully used in a number of tasks in natural language processing (NLP).
These include, but are not limited to, language
modeling (Bengio et al., 2003), paraphrase detection (Socher et al., 2011) and word embedding extraction (Mikolov et al., 2013). In the field of statistical machine translation (SMT), deep neural
networks have begun to show promising results.
(Schwenk, 2012) summarizes a successful usage
of feedforward neural networks in the framework
of phrase-based SMT system.
Along this line of research on using neural networks for SMT, this paper focuses on a novel neural network architecture that can be used as a part
of the conventional phrase-based SMT system.
The proposed neural network architecture, which
we will refer to as an RNN Encoder–Decoder, consists of two recurrent neural networks (RNN) that
act as an encoder and a decoder pair. The encoder maps a variable-length source sequence to a
fixed-length vector, and the decoder maps the vector representation back to a variable-length target
sequence. The two networks are trained jointly to
maximize the conditional probability of the target
sequence given a source sequence. Additionally,
we propose to use a rather sophisticated hidden
unit in order to improve both the memory capacity
and the ease of training.
The proposed RNN Encoder–Decoder with a
novel hidden unit is empirically evaluated on the
task of translating from English to French. We
train the model to learn the translation probability of an English phrase to a corresponding French
phrase. The model is then used as a part of a standard phrase-based SMT system by scoring each
phrase pair in the phrase table. The empirical evaluation reveals that this approach of scoring phrase
pairs with an RNN Encoder–Decoder improves
the translation performance.
We qualitatively analyze the trained RNN
Encoder–Decoder by comparing its phrase scores
with those given by the existing translation model.
The qualitative analysis shows that the RNN
Encoder–Decoder is better at capturing the linguistic regularities in the phrase table, indirectly
explaining the quantitative improvements in the
overall translation performance. The further analysis of the model reveals that the RNN Encoder–
Decoder learns a continuous space representation
of a phrase that preserves both the semantic and
syntactic structure of the phrase.
Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a new neural network
architecture, called an RNN Encoder–Decoder
that is able to learn the mapping from a sequence
of an arbitrary length to another sequence, possibly from a different set, of an arbitrary length. The
proposed RNN Encoder–Decoder is able to either
score a pair of sequences (in terms of a conditional
probability) or generate a target sequence given a
source sequence. Along with the new architecture,
we proposed a novel hidden unit that includes a reset gate and an update gate that adaptively control
how much each hidden unit remembers or forgets
while reading/generating a sequence.
We evaluated the proposed model with the task
of statistical machine translation, where we used
the RNN Encoder–Decoder to score each phrase
pair in the phrase table. Qualitatively, we were
able to show that the new model is able to capture linguistic regularities in the phrase pairs well
and also that the RNN Encoder–Decoder is able to
propose well-formed target phrases.
The scores by the RNN Encoder–Decoder were
found to improve the overall translation performance in terms of BLEU scores. Also, we
found that the contribution by the RNN Encoder–
Decoder is rather orthogonal to the existing approach of using neural networks in the SMT system, so that we can improve further the performance by using, for instance, the RNN Encoder–
Decoder and the neural net language model together.
Our qualitative analysis of the trained model
shows that it indeed captures the linguistic regularities in multiple levels i.e. at the word level as
well as phrase level. This suggests that there may
be more natural language related applications that
may benefit from the proposed RNN Encoder–
Decoder.
The proposed architecture has large potential
for further improvement and analysis. One approach that was not investigated here is to replace the whole, or a part of the phrase table by
letting the RNN Encoder–Decoder propose target
phrases. Also, noting that the proposed model is
not limited to being used with written language,
it will be an important future research to apply the
proposed architecture to other applications such as
speech transcription.

ABSTRACT
State-of-the-art methods for learning cross-lingual word embeddings have relied
on bilingual dictionaries or parallel corpora. Recent studies showed that the need
for parallel data supervision can be alleviated with character-level information.
While these methods showed encouraging results, they are not on par with their
supervised counterparts and are limited to pairs of languages sharing a common
alphabet. In this work, we show that we can build a bilingual dictionary between
two languages without using any parallel corpora, by aligning monolingual word
embedding spaces in an unsupervised way. Without using any character information, our model even outperforms existing supervised methods on cross-lingual
tasks for some language pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that our method
works very well also for distant language pairs, like English-Russian or EnglishChinese. We finally describe experiments on the English-Esperanto low-resource
language pair, on which there only exists a limited amount of parallel data, to show
the potential impact of our method in fully unsupervised machine translation. Our
code, embeddings and dictionaries are publicly available1.
 INTRODUCTION
Most successful methods for learning distributed representations of words (e.g. Mikolov et al.
(2013c;a); Pennington et al. (2014); Bojanowski et al. (2017)) rely on the distributional hypothesis of Harris (1954), which states that words occurring in similar contexts tend to have similar
meanings. Levy & Goldberg (2014) show that the skip-gram with negative sampling method of
Mikolov et al. (2013c) amounts to factorizing a word-context co-occurrence matrix, whose entries
are the pointwise mutual information of the respective word and context pairs. Exploiting word cooccurrence statistics leads to word vectors that reflect the semantic similarities and dissimilarities:
similar words are close in the embedding space and conversely.
Mikolov et al. (2013b) first noticed that continuous word embedding spaces exhibit similar structures
across languages, even when considering distant language pairs like English and Vietnamese. They
proposed to exploit this similarity by learning a linear mapping from a source to a target embedding
space. They employed a parallel vocabulary of five thousand words as anchor points to learn this
mapping and evaluated their approach on a word translation task. Since then, several studies aimed
at improving these cross-lingual word embeddings (Faruqui & Dyer (2014); Xing et al. (2015);
Lazaridou et al. (2015); Ammar et al. (2016); Artetxe et al. (2016); Smith et al. (2017)), but they all
rely on bilingual word lexicons.
Recent attempts at reducing the need for bilingual supervision (Smith et al., 2017) employ identical
character strings to form a parallel vocabulary. The iterative method of Artetxe et al. (2017) gradually aligns embedding spaces, starting from a parallel vocabulary of aligned digits. These methods
are however limited to similar languages sharing a common alphabet, such as European languages.
Some recent methods explored distribution-based approach (Cao et al., 2016) or adversarial training
Zhang et al. (2017b) to obtain cross-lingual word embeddings without any parallel data. While these
approaches sound appealing, their performance is significantly below supervised methods. To sum
up, current methods have either not reached competitive performance, or they still require parallel
data, such as aligned corpora (Gouws et al., 2015; Vulic & Moens, 2015) or a seed parallel lexicon
(Duong et al., 2016).
In this paper, we introduce a model that either is on par, or outperforms supervised state-of-the-art
methods, without employing any cross-lingual annotated data. We only use two large monolingual
corpora, one in the source and one in the target language. Our method leverages adversarial training
to learn a linear mapping from a source to a target space and operates in two steps. First, in a twoplayer game, a discriminator is trained to distinguish between the mapped source embeddings and
the target embeddings, while the mapping (which can be seen as a generator) is jointly trained to fool
the discriminator. Second, we extract a synthetic dictionary from the resulting shared embedding
space and fine-tune the mapping with the closed-form Procrustes solution from Schonemann (1966). ¨
Since the method is unsupervised, cross-lingual data can not be used to select the best model. To
overcome this issue, we introduce an unsupervised selection metric that is highly correlated with the
mapping quality and that we use both as a stopping criterion and to select the best hyper-parameters.
In summary, this paper makes the following main contributions:
• We present an unsupervised approach that reaches or outperforms state-of-the-art supervised approaches on several language pairs and on three different evaluation tasks, namely
word translation, sentence translation retrieval, and cross-lingual word similarity. On
a standard word translation retrieval benchmark, using 200k vocabularies, our method
reaches 66.2% accuracy on English-Italian while the best supervised approach is at 63.7%.
• We introduce a cross-domain similarity adaptation to mitigate the so-called hubness problem (points tending to be nearest neighbors of many points in high-dimensional spaces). It
is inspired by the self-tuning method from Zelnik-manor & Perona (2005), but adapted to
our two-domain scenario in which we must consider a bi-partite graph for neighbors. This
approach significantly improves the absolute performance, and outperforms the state of the
art both in supervised and unsupervised setups on word-translation benchmarks.
• We propose an unsupervised criterion that is highly correlated with the quality of the mapping, that can be used both as a stopping criterion and to select the best hyper-parameters.
• We release high-quality dictionaries for 12 oriented languages pairs, as well as the corresponding supervised and unsupervised word embeddings.
• We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using an example of a low-resource language pair where parallel corpora are not available (English-Esperanto) for which our
method is particularly suited.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our unsupervised approach with adversarial
training and our refinement procedure. We then present our training procedure with unsupervised
model selection in Section 3. We report in Section 4 our results on several cross-lingual tasks for
several language pairs and compare our approach to supervised methods. Finally, we explain how
our approach differs from recent related work on learning cross-lingual word embeddings.
CONCLUSION
In this work, we show for the first time that one can align word embedding spaces without any
cross-lingual supervision, i.e., solely based on unaligned datasets of each language, while reaching
or outperforming the quality of previous supervised approaches in several cases. Using adversarial
training, we are able to initialize a linear mapping between a source and a target space, which we
also use to produce a synthetic parallel dictionary. It is then possible to apply the same techniques
proposed for supervised techniques, namely a Procrustean optimization. Two key ingredients contribute to the success of our approach: First we propose a simple criterion that is used as an effective
unsupervised validation metric. Second we propose the similarity measure CSLS, which mitigates
the hubness problem and drastically increases the word translation accuracy. As a result, our approach produces high-quality dictionaries between different pairs of languages, with up to 83.3% on
the Spanish-English word translation task. This performance is on par with supervised approaches.
Our method is also effective on the English-Esperanto pair, thereby showing that it works for lowresource language pairs, and can be used as a first step towards unsupervised machine translation.
