Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model called RNN Encoder–
Decoder that consists of two recurrent
neural networks (RNN). One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixedlength vector representation, and the other
decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly
trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source
sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder–Decoder as an
additional feature in the existing log-linear
model. Qualitatively, we show that the
proposed model learns a semantically and
syntactically meaningful representation of
linguistic phrases.
Introduction
Deep neural networks have shown great success in
various applications such as objection recognition
(see, e.g., (Krizhevsky et al., 2012)) and speech
recognition (see, e.g., (Dahl et al., 2012)). Furthermore, many recent works showed that neural networks can be successfully used in a number of tasks in natural language processing (NLP).
These include, but are not limited to, language
modeling (Bengio et al., 2003), paraphrase detection (Socher et al., 2011) and word embedding extraction (Mikolov et al., 2013). In the field of statistical machine translation (SMT), deep neural
networks have begun to show promising results.
(Schwenk, 2012) summarizes a successful usage
of feedforward neural networks in the framework
of phrase-based SMT system.
Along this line of research on using neural networks for SMT, this paper focuses on a novel neural network architecture that can be used as a part
of the conventional phrase-based SMT system.
The proposed neural network architecture, which
we will refer to as an RNN Encoder–Decoder, consists of two recurrent neural networks (RNN) that
act as an encoder and a decoder pair. The encoder maps a variable-length source sequence to a
fixed-length vector, and the decoder maps the vector representation back to a variable-length target
sequence. The two networks are trained jointly to
maximize the conditional probability of the target
sequence given a source sequence. Additionally,
we propose to use a rather sophisticated hidden
unit in order to improve both the memory capacity
and the ease of training.
The proposed RNN Encoder–Decoder with a
novel hidden unit is empirically evaluated on the
task of translating from English to French. We
train the model to learn the translation probability of an English phrase to a corresponding French
phrase. The model is then used as a part of a standard phrase-based SMT system by scoring each
phrase pair in the phrase table. The empirical evaluation reveals that this approach of scoring phrase
pairs with an RNN Encoder–Decoder improves
the translation performance.
We qualitatively analyze the trained RNN
Encoder–Decoder by comparing its phrase scores
with those given by the existing translation model.
The qualitative analysis shows that the RNN
Encoder–Decoder is better at capturing the linguistic regularities in the phrase table, indirectly
explaining the quantitative improvements in the
overall translation performance. The further analysis of the model reveals that the RNN Encoder–
Decoder learns a continuous space representation
of a phrase that preserves both the semantic and
syntactic structure of the phrase.
Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a new neural network
architecture, called an RNN Encoder–Decoder
that is able to learn the mapping from a sequence
of an arbitrary length to another sequence, possibly from a different set, of an arbitrary length. The
proposed RNN Encoder–Decoder is able to either
score a pair of sequences (in terms of a conditional
probability) or generate a target sequence given a
source sequence. Along with the new architecture,
we proposed a novel hidden unit that includes a reset gate and an update gate that adaptively control
how much each hidden unit remembers or forgets
while reading/generating a sequence.
We evaluated the proposed model with the task
of statistical machine translation, where we used
the RNN Encoder–Decoder to score each phrase
pair in the phrase table. Qualitatively, we were
able to show that the new model is able to capture linguistic regularities in the phrase pairs well
and also that the RNN Encoder–Decoder is able to
propose well-formed target phrases.
The scores by the RNN Encoder–Decoder were
found to improve the overall translation performance in terms of BLEU scores. Also, we
found that the contribution by the RNN Encoder–
Decoder is rather orthogonal to the existing approach of using neural networks in the SMT system, so that we can improve further the performance by using, for instance, the RNN Encoder–
Decoder and the neural net language model together.
Our qualitative analysis of the trained model
shows that it indeed captures the linguistic regularities in multiple levels i.e. at the word level as
well as phrase level. This suggests that there may
be more natural language related applications that
may benefit from the proposed RNN Encoder–
Decoder.
The proposed architecture has large potential
for further improvement and analysis. One approach that was not investigated here is to replace the whole, or a part of the phrase table by
letting the RNN Encoder–Decoder propose target
phrases. Also, noting that the proposed model is
not limited to being used with written language,
it will be an important future research to apply the
proposed architecture to other applications such as
speech transcription.

Abstract
This article offers an empirical exploration on the use of character-level convolutional networks (ConvNets) for text classification. We constructed several largescale datasets to show that character-level convolutional networks could achieve
state-of-the-art or competitive results. Comparisons are offered against traditional
models such as bag of words, n-grams and their TFIDF variants, and deep learning
models such as word-based ConvNets and recurrent neural networks.
Introduction
Text classification is a classic topic for natural language processing, in which one needs to assign
predefined categories to free-text documents. The range of text classification research goes from
designing the best features to choosing the best possible machine learning classifiers. To date,
almost all techniques of text classification are based on words, in which simple statistics of some
ordered word combinations (such as n-grams) usually perform the best [12].
On the other hand, many researchers have found convolutional networks (ConvNets) [17] [18] are
useful in extracting information from raw signals, ranging from computer vision applications to
speech recognition and others. In particular, time-delay networks used in the early days of deep
learning research are essentially convolutional networks that model sequential data [1] [31].
In this article we explore treating text as a kind of raw signal at character level, and applying temporal (one-dimensional) ConvNets to it. For this article we only used a classification task as a way
to exemplify ConvNets’ ability to understand texts. Historically we know that ConvNets usually
require large-scale datasets to work, therefore we also build several of them. An extensive set of
comparisons is offered with traditional models and other deep learning models.
Applying convolutional networks to text classification or natural language processing at large was
explored in literature. It has been shown that ConvNets can be directly applied to distributed [6] [16]
or discrete [13] embedding of words, without any knowledge on the syntactic or semantic structures
of a language. These approaches have been proven to be competitive to traditional models.
There are also related works that use character-level features for language processing. These include using character-level n-grams with linear classifiers [15], and incorporating character-level
features to ConvNets [28] [29]. In particular, these ConvNet approaches use words as a basis, in
which character-level features extracted at word [28] or word n-gram [29] level form a distributed
representation. Improvements for part-of-speech tagging and information retrieval were observed.
This article is the first to apply ConvNets only on characters. We show that when trained on largescale datasets, deep ConvNets do not require the knowledge of words, in addition to the conclusion
from previous research that ConvNets do not require the knowledge about the syntactic or semantic
structure of a language. This simplification of engineering could be crucial for a single system that
can work for different languages, since characters always constitute a necessary construct regardless
of whether segmentation into words is possible. Working on only characters also has the advantage
that abnormal character combinations such as misspellings and emoticons may be naturally learnt.
Conclusion and Outlook
This article offers an empirical study on character-level convolutional networks for text classification. We compared with a large number of traditional and deep learning models using several largescale datasets. On one hand, analysis shows that character-level ConvNet is an effective method.
On the other hand, how well our model performs in comparisons depends on many factors, such as
dataset size, whether the texts are curated and choice of alphabet.
In the future, we hope to apply character-level ConvNets for a broader range of language processing
tasks especially when structured outputs are needed.
