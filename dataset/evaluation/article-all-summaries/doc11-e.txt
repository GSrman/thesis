**Ethical Aspects Discussed in Abstract: None specifically mentioned.**


**Notes on Ethics from Introduction and Conclusion:**

- **Privacy:** Not directly discussed, but character-level analysis might process sensitive texts which
require privacy considerations.

- **Bias and Fairness:** Potential bias in language models due to dataset composition is implicit; fair use
across languages must be considered given the application to different languages.
 Writers or researchers should ensure that their datasets are not biased towards particular demographics or
linguistic groups.

- **Transparency:** The abstract implies a need for transparency in methodology and model interpretability,
especially when dealing with language processing tasks where understanding the decision process is crucial.

- **Dual Use:** Not directly mentioned, but ConvNets could be applied to sensitive or harmful applications;
thus, dual use considerations are implied.

- **Accessibility:** The simplification of engineering by using character-level features suggests an aim
towards broader accessibility across languages and potentially different skill levels in understanding the
models' operation.

- **Data Collection:** Large-scale datasets were created, indicating that ethical data collection practices
are assumed to be followed during dataset creation.
