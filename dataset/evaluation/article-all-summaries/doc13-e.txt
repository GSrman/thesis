1. Bias and Fairness: The paper focuses on advancements in neural machine translation but does not
explicitly address bias or fairness within the models developed, which is an aspect that could influence
ethical AI deployment across different languages and demographics.

2. Privacy: While privacy isn't directly mentioned in this excerpt, considerations around data handling for
training such models are inherent to the process but not detailed herein.

3. Transparency: The research highlights improvements in translation quality; however, there is no explicit
discussion on how transparent the model processes and decisions are, which affects user trust and
interpretability.

4. Dual Use: No specific mention of dual use concerns regarding neural machine translations in this excerpt.
However, as a general ethical aspect, it would be pertinent to discuss if these models could serve both
positive (e.g., communication facilitation) and negative purposes (e.g., misinformation spread).

5. Accessibility: The paper does not address the accessibility of its proposed model or how well it can
cater to users with disabilities or those from different socio-economic backgrounds, which is an important
ethical consideration in AI research.

6. Data Collection: Although data collection is a fundamental aspect for training machine translation
models, there is no direct mention of this within the excerpt provided. It's implied through the process but
not detailed here.
