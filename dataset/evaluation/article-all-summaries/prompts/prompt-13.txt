Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model called RNN Encoderâ€“
Decoder that consists of two recurrent
neural networks (RNN). One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixedlength vector representation, and the other
decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly
trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source
sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoderâ€“Decoder as an
additional feature in the existing log-linear
model. Qualitatively, we show that the
proposed model learns a semantically and
syntactically meaningful representation of
linguistic phrases.
Introduction
Deep neural networks have shown great success in
various applications such as objection recognition
(see, e.g., (Krizhevsky et al., 2012)) and speech
recognition (see, e.g., (Dahl et al., 2012)). Furthermore, many recent works showed that neural networks can be successfully used in a number of tasks in natural language processing (NLP).
These include, but are not limited to, language
modeling (Bengio et al., 2003), paraphrase detection (Socher et al., 2011) and word embedding extraction (Mikolov et al., 2013). In the field of statistical machine translation (SMT), deep neural
networks have begun to show promising results.
(Schwenk, 2012) summarizes a successful usage
of feedforward neural networks in the framework
of phrase-based SMT system.
Along this line of research on using neural networks for SMT, this paper focuses on a novel neural network architecture that can be used as a part
of the conventional phrase-based SMT system.
The proposed neural network architecture, which
we will refer to as an RNN Encoderâ€“Decoder, consists of two recurrent neural networks (RNN) that
act as an encoder and a decoder pair. The encoder maps a variable-length source sequence to a
fixed-length vector, and the decoder maps the vector representation back to a variable-length target
sequence. The two networks are trained jointly to
maximize the conditional probability of the target
sequence given a source sequence. Additionally,
we propose to use a rather sophisticated hidden
unit in order to improve both the memory capacity
and the ease of training.
The proposed RNN Encoderâ€“Decoder with a
novel hidden unit is empirically evaluated on the
task of translating from English to French. We
train the model to learn the translation probability of an English phrase to a corresponding French
phrase. The model is then used as a part of a standard phrase-based SMT system by scoring each
phrase pair in the phrase table. The empirical evaluation reveals that this approach of scoring phrase
pairs with an RNN Encoderâ€“Decoder improves
the translation performance.
We qualitatively analyze the trained RNN
Encoderâ€“Decoder by comparing its phrase scores
with those given by the existing translation model.
The qualitative analysis shows that the RNN
Encoderâ€“Decoder is better at capturing the linguistic regularities in the phrase table, indirectly
explaining the quantitative improvements in the
overall translation performance. The further analysis of the model reveals that the RNN Encoderâ€“
Decoder learns a continuous space representation
of a phrase that preserves both the semantic and
syntactic structure of the phrase.
Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a new neural network
architecture, called an RNN Encoderâ€“Decoder
that is able to learn the mapping from a sequence
of an arbitrary length to another sequence, possibly from a different set, of an arbitrary length. The
proposed RNN Encoderâ€“Decoder is able to either
score a pair of sequences (in terms of a conditional
probability) or generate a target sequence given a
source sequence. Along with the new architecture,
we proposed a novel hidden unit that includes a reset gate and an update gate that adaptively control
how much each hidden unit remembers or forgets
while reading/generating a sequence.
We evaluated the proposed model with the task
of statistical machine translation, where we used
the RNN Encoderâ€“Decoder to score each phrase
pair in the phrase table. Qualitatively, we were
able to show that the new model is able to capture linguistic regularities in the phrase pairs well
and also that the RNN Encoderâ€“Decoder is able to
propose well-formed target phrases.
The scores by the RNN Encoderâ€“Decoder were
found to improve the overall translation performance in terms of BLEU scores. Also, we
found that the contribution by the RNN Encoderâ€“
Decoder is rather orthogonal to the existing approach of using neural networks in the SMT system, so that we can improve further the performance by using, for instance, the RNN Encoderâ€“
Decoder and the neural net language model together.
Our qualitative analysis of the trained model
shows that it indeed captures the linguistic regularities in multiple levels i.e. at the word level as
well as phrase level. This suggests that there may
be more natural language related applications that
may benefit from the proposed RNN Encoderâ€“
Decoder.
The proposed architecture has large potential
for further improvement and analysis. One approach that was not investigated here is to replace the whole, or a part of the phrase table by
letting the RNN Encoderâ€“Decoder propose target
phrases. Also, noting that the proposed model is
not limited to being used with written language,
it will be an important future research to apply the
proposed architecture to other applications such as
speech transcription.

ABSTRACT
Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine
translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to
maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoderâ€“decoders and encode
a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a
translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a
bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoderâ€“decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search
for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without
having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach,
we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art
phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore,
qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree
well with our intuition.
INTRODUCTION
Neural machine translation is a newly emerging approach to machine translation, recently proposed
by Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013), Sutskever et al. (2014) and Cho et al. (2014b). Unlike the
traditional phrase-based translation system (see, e.g., Koehn et al., 2003) which consists of many
small sub-components that are tuned separately, neural machine translation attempts to build and
train a single, large neural network that reads a sentence and outputs a correct translation.
Most of the proposed neural machine translation models belong to a family of encoderâ€“
decoders (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014a), with an encoder and a decoder for each language, or involve a language-specific encoder applied to each sentence whose outputs are then compared (Hermann and Blunsom, 2014). An encoder neural network reads and encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector. A decoder then outputs a translation from the encoded vector. The
whole encoderâ€“decoder system, which consists of the encoder and the decoder for a language pair,
is jointly trained to maximize the probability of a correct translation given a source sentence.
A potential issue with this encoderâ€“decoder approach is that a neural network needs to be able to
compress all the necessary information of a source sentence into a fixed-length vector. This may
make it difficult for the neural network to cope with long sentences, especially those that are longer
than the sentences in the training corpus. Cho et al. (2014b) showed that indeed the performance of
a basic encoderâ€“decoder deteriorates rapidly as the length of an input sentence increases.
In order to address this issue, we introduce an extension to the encoderâ€“decoder model which learns
to align and translate jointly. Each time the proposed model generates a word in a translation, it
(soft-)searches for a set of positions in a source sentence where the most relevant information is
concentrated. The model then predicts a target word based on the context vectors associated with
these source positions and all the previous generated target words.
The most important distinguishing feature of this approach from the basic encoderâ€“decoder is that
it does not attempt to encode a whole input sentence into a single fixed-length vector. Instead, it encodes the input sentence into a sequence of vectors and chooses a subset of these vectors adaptively
while decoding the translation. This frees a neural translation model from having to squash all the
information of a source sentence, regardless of its length, into a fixed-length vector. We show this
allows a model to cope better with long sentences.
In this paper, we show that the proposed approach of jointly learning to align and translate achieves
significantly improved translation performance over the basic encoderâ€“decoder approach. The improvement is more apparent with longer sentences, but can be observed with sentences of any
length. On the task of English-to-French translation, the proposed approach achieves, with a single
model, a translation performance comparable, or close, to the conventional phrase-based system.
Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the proposed model finds a linguistically plausible
(soft-)alignment between a source sentence and the corresponding target sentence.
 CONCLUSION
The conventional approach to neural machine translation, called an encoderâ€“decoder approach, encodes a whole input sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a translation will be decoded.
We conjectured that the use of a fixed-length context vector is problematic for translating long sentences, based on a recent empirical study reported by Cho et al. (2014b) and Pouget-Abadie et al.
(2014).
In this paper, we proposed a novel architecture that addresses this issue. We extended the basic
encoderâ€“decoder by letting a model (soft-)search for a set of input words, or their annotations computed by an encoder, when generating each target word. This frees the model from having to encode
a whole source sentence into a fixed-length vector, and also lets the model focus only on information
relevant to the generation of the next target word. This has a major positive impact on the ability
of the neural machine translation system to yield good results on longer sentences. Unlike with
the traditional machine translation systems, all of the pieces of the translation system, including
the alignment mechanism, are jointly trained towards a better log-probability of producing correct
translations.
We tested the proposed model, called RNNsearch, on the task of English-to-French translation. The
experiment revealed that the proposed RNNsearch outperforms the conventional encoderâ€“decoder
model (RNNencdec) significantly, regardless of the sentence length and that it is much more robust to the length of a source sentence. From the qualitative analysis where we investigated the
(soft-)alignment generated by the RNNsearch, we were able to conclude that the model can correctly align each target word with the relevant words, or their annotations, in the source sentence as
it generated a correct translation.
Perhaps more importantly, the proposed approach achieved a translation performance comparable to
the existing phrase-based statistical machine translation. It is a striking result, considering that the
proposed architecture, or the whole family of neural machine translation, has only been proposed
as recently as this year. We believe the architecture proposed here is a promising step toward better
machine translation and a better understanding of natural languages in general.
One of challenges left for the future is to better handle unknown, or rare words. This will be required
for the model to be more widely used and to match the performance of current state-of-the-art
machine translation systems in all contexts.
