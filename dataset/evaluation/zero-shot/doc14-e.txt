**Bias and Fairness:** The paper's approach does not explicitly
address bias or fairness in the cross-lingual embeddings generated;
however, by using monolingual corpora from diverse sources, it
indirectly promotes data diversity which could contribute to more
equitable representations.


**Privacy:** There is no direct mention of privacy concerns within
this paper's methodology as the shared dictionary and embeddings are
publicly released for research purposes.


**Transparency:** The authors release dictionaries and word
embeddings, which indicates a level of transparency in their process.
They also describe each step of their approach, contributing to their
overall transparency.


**Accessibility:** By making the dictionary and word embeddings
publicly available for 12 language pairs, this paper improves
accessibility for researchers working with low-resource languages or
those interested in cross-lingual analysis.


**Data Access:** The approach relies on monolingual datasets from each
language without using any additional parallel corpora, thus it does
not directly address data access issues but circumvents the need for
expensive and often scarce cross-lingual resources.
