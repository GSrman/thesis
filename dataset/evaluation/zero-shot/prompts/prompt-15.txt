For the following research paper segments, make a short bulletpoint summary of the following ethical aspects: Bias and fairness, Privacy, Transparency, Dual Use, Accessibility, Data collection. If an aspect is not discussed, say so.

Abstract
In this paper we present the results of a manual
classification of all ethical consideration sections for ACL 2021. We also compare how
many papers had an ethics consideration section per track and per world region in ACL
2021. We classified papers according to the
ethical issues covered (research benefits, potential harms, and vulnerable groups affected)
and whether the paper was marked as requiring
ethics review by at least one reviewer. Moreover, we discuss recurring obstacles we have
observed (highlighting some interesting texts
we found along the way) and conclude with
three suggestions. We think that this paper may
be useful for anyone who needs to write — or
review — an ethics section and would like to
get an overview of what others have done.
 Introduction
The first conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) to include an ethics
advisory committee was the one organized by its
North American Chapter (NAACL) in 2021. Since
then all ACL conferences have had one, including
all chapter conferences, and the largest conferences
ACL-IJCNLP and EMNLP. The ACL 2021 webpage call for papers says the following.1
Authors will be allowed extra space after the
8th page for a broader impact statement or
other discussion of ethics. Note that though the
ethical consideration paragraph is not mandatory, authors of papers working with sensitive
data or on sensitive tasks that do not sufficiently
discuss these issues may receive a conditional
acceptance recommendation.
This paper examines the current state of the NLP
research community’s discussion of the ethical impact of its work, as reflected in its publications. We
first pose five empirical questions, and then explore
possible obstacles to the discussion. The paper is
organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews related work, giving references relevant to several
areas of NLP. In Section 3 we explore the following five questions regarding ethical consideration
sections in ACL 2021 papers:
• What percentage of papers include an ethical
considerations section (ECS)?
• Are there some tracks that stand out, either
positively or negatively?
• What types of ethical questions are addressed
in ECSs, and in what proportion?
• Are the papers with ECSs that went through
ethics review different from those that did not?
• Are there differences between countries with
respect to the ECSs?
In Section 4 we consider obstacles that may impede the discussion of ethical issues in research
papers, and how they might be overcome. In Section 5 we propose three concrete suggestions that
can be useful in the future for authors, reviewers
and ethics chairs. After the conclusions in Section 6 we discuss the ethical considerations and the
limitations of this work.
Conclusions
We believe our paper may be useful for authors
writing an ethics section — and perhaps even for
reviewers of such sections — who would like to get
an overview of what others have done, including
what might be addressed (benefits, harms, vulnerable groups).
This paper provides a dive into the contents of
ethical consideration sections (ECS) in ACL proceedings papers from last year. Specifically, the
paper compares the percentages of papers containing ECS from different countries and the contents
of these ECS. We also discuss the types of obstacles facing ECS writers, and provide concrete
suggestions for authors, reviewers, and organizers.
We wrote this paper because we think it is important to inspire the community to think about
the social impacts of their work. We value diverse
perspectives — so we do not supply cut-and-dried
solutions to the issues we raise. Rather, we have
tried to make ethical discussions more meaningful
by drawing attention to what has already been done
in ECSs. The statistics we reported are simple and
basic, and doubtless more detailed analyses will
be made as more data becomes available. But our
main goal here was to raise these issues clearly and
directly — and as soon as possible — to the NLP
community.
Ethical considerations
Ethics reviewing in NLP was first implemented in
June 2021 for NAACL 2021. In this paper we addressed the following questions about papers published at ACL 2021 in August 2021. 1) What percentage of papers include an ethical considerations
section (ECS)? 2) Are there some tracks that stand
out, either positively or negatively? 3) What types
of ethical questions are addressed in ECSs, and in
what proportion? 4) Are the papers with ECSs that
went through ethics review different from those that
did not? 5) Are there differences between countries with respect to the ECSs?. We also describe
common obstacles and arguments regarding ECSs
and illustrate papers that have overcome them insightfully. Potential harms of our paper include
over-generalizations of the empirical results we
show here so we want to make our limitations explicit and we do so in the next section. One of our
reviewers pointed out that a potential harm is that
this paper raises opinions about the Ethics Consideration Section, which is to some extent sensitive,
and that may affect the point of view of other authors toward ECS. To this we can only say: trying
to raise awareness and stimulate open discussion
of ECSs in the NLP community seems better than
leaving them unexamined..
We believe this paper might benefit NLP researchers who are authors, reviewers or conference
organizers in different ways. Authors might find
in this paper tools to come up with better ECSs.
Ethics reviewers might see the impact of their effort.
And organizers could have a glimpse at questions
addressed and not addressed by ECSs. Our goal
is to contribute to the ongoing debate on what is
the current situation of the broader societal impact
discussions of NLP research.
