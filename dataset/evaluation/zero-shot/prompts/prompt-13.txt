ABSTRACT
Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine
translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to
maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder–decoders and encode
a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a
translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a
bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder–decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search
for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without
having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach,
we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art
phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore,
qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree
well with our intuition.
INTRODUCTION
Neural machine translation is a newly emerging approach to machine translation, recently proposed
by Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013), Sutskever et al. (2014) and Cho et al. (2014b). Unlike the
traditional phrase-based translation system (see, e.g., Koehn et al., 2003) which consists of many
small sub-components that are tuned separately, neural machine translation attempts to build and
train a single, large neural network that reads a sentence and outputs a correct translation.
Most of the proposed neural machine translation models belong to a family of encoder–
decoders (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014a), with an encoder and a decoder for each language, or involve a language-specific encoder applied to each sentence whose outputs are then compared (Hermann and Blunsom, 2014). An encoder neural network reads and encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector. A decoder then outputs a translation from the encoded vector. The
whole encoder–decoder system, which consists of the encoder and the decoder for a language pair,
is jointly trained to maximize the probability of a correct translation given a source sentence.
A potential issue with this encoder–decoder approach is that a neural network needs to be able to
compress all the necessary information of a source sentence into a fixed-length vector. This may
make it difficult for the neural network to cope with long sentences, especially those that are longer
than the sentences in the training corpus. Cho et al. (2014b) showed that indeed the performance of
a basic encoder–decoder deteriorates rapidly as the length of an input sentence increases.
In order to address this issue, we introduce an extension to the encoder–decoder model which learns
to align and translate jointly. Each time the proposed model generates a word in a translation, it
(soft-)searches for a set of positions in a source sentence where the most relevant information is
concentrated. The model then predicts a target word based on the context vectors associated with
these source positions and all the previous generated target words.
The most important distinguishing feature of this approach from the basic encoder–decoder is that
it does not attempt to encode a whole input sentence into a single fixed-length vector. Instead, it encodes the input sentence into a sequence of vectors and chooses a subset of these vectors adaptively
while decoding the translation. This frees a neural translation model from having to squash all the
information of a source sentence, regardless of its length, into a fixed-length vector. We show this
allows a model to cope better with long sentences.
In this paper, we show that the proposed approach of jointly learning to align and translate achieves
significantly improved translation performance over the basic encoder–decoder approach. The improvement is more apparent with longer sentences, but can be observed with sentences of any
length. On the task of English-to-French translation, the proposed approach achieves, with a single
model, a translation performance comparable, or close, to the conventional phrase-based system.
Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the proposed model finds a linguistically plausible
(soft-)alignment between a source sentence and the corresponding target sentence.
 CONCLUSION
The conventional approach to neural machine translation, called an encoder–decoder approach, encodes a whole input sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a translation will be decoded.
We conjectured that the use of a fixed-length context vector is problematic for translating long sentences, based on a recent empirical study reported by Cho et al. (2014b) and Pouget-Abadie et al.
(2014).
In this paper, we proposed a novel architecture that addresses this issue. We extended the basic
encoder–decoder by letting a model (soft-)search for a set of input words, or their annotations computed by an encoder, when generating each target word. This frees the model from having to encode
a whole source sentence into a fixed-length vector, and also lets the model focus only on information
relevant to the generation of the next target word. This has a major positive impact on the ability
of the neural machine translation system to yield good results on longer sentences. Unlike with
the traditional machine translation systems, all of the pieces of the translation system, including
the alignment mechanism, are jointly trained towards a better log-probability of producing correct
translations.
We tested the proposed model, called RNNsearch, on the task of English-to-French translation. The
experiment revealed that the proposed RNNsearch outperforms the conventional encoder–decoder
model (RNNencdec) significantly, regardless of the sentence length and that it is much more robust to the length of a source sentence. From the qualitative analysis where we investigated the
(soft-)alignment generated by the RNNsearch, we were able to conclude that the model can correctly align each target word with the relevant words, or their annotations, in the source sentence as
it generated a correct translation.
Perhaps more importantly, the proposed approach achieved a translation performance comparable to
the existing phrase-based statistical machine translation. It is a striking result, considering that the
proposed architecture, or the whole family of neural machine translation, has only been proposed
as recently as this year. We believe the architecture proposed here is a promising step toward better
machine translation and a better understanding of natural languages in general.
One of challenges left for the future is to better handle unknown, or rare words. This will be required
for the model to be more widely used and to match the performance of current state-of-the-art
machine translation systems in all contexts.
