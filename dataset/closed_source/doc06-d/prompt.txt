Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model called RNN Encoder–
Decoder that consists of two recurrent
neural networks (RNN). One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixedlength vector representation, and the other
decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly
trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source
sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder–Decoder as an
additional feature in the existing log-linear
model. Qualitatively, we show that the
proposed model learns a semantically and
syntactically meaningful representation of
linguistic phrases.
Introduction
Deep neural networks have shown great success in
various applications such as objection recognition
(see, e.g., (Krizhevsky et al., 2012)) and speech
recognition (see, e.g., (Dahl et al., 2012)). Furthermore, many recent works showed that neural networks can be successfully used in a number of tasks in natural language processing (NLP).
These include, but are not limited to, language
modeling (Bengio et al., 2003), paraphrase detection (Socher et al., 2011) and word embedding extraction (Mikolov et al., 2013). In the field of statistical machine translation (SMT), deep neural
networks have begun to show promising results.
(Schwenk, 2012) summarizes a successful usage
of feedforward neural networks in the framework
of phrase-based SMT system.
Along this line of research on using neural networks for SMT, this paper focuses on a novel neural network architecture that can be used as a part
of the conventional phrase-based SMT system.
The proposed neural network architecture, which
we will refer to as an RNN Encoder–Decoder, consists of two recurrent neural networks (RNN) that
act as an encoder and a decoder pair. The encoder maps a variable-length source sequence to a
fixed-length vector, and the decoder maps the vector representation back to a variable-length target
sequence. The two networks are trained jointly to
maximize the conditional probability of the target
sequence given a source sequence. Additionally,
we propose to use a rather sophisticated hidden
unit in order to improve both the memory capacity
and the ease of training.
The proposed RNN Encoder–Decoder with a
novel hidden unit is empirically evaluated on the
task of translating from English to French. We
train the model to learn the translation probability of an English phrase to a corresponding French
phrase. The model is then used as a part of a standard phrase-based SMT system by scoring each
phrase pair in the phrase table. The empirical evaluation reveals that this approach of scoring phrase
pairs with an RNN Encoder–Decoder improves
the translation performance.
We qualitatively analyze the trained RNN
Encoder–Decoder by comparing its phrase scores
with those given by the existing translation model.
The qualitative analysis shows that the RNN
Encoder–Decoder is better at capturing the linguistic regularities in the phrase table, indirectly
explaining the quantitative improvements in the
overall translation performance. The further analysis of the model reveals that the RNN Encoder–
Decoder learns a continuous space representation
of a phrase that preserves both the semantic and
syntactic structure of the phrase.
Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a new neural network
architecture, called an RNN Encoder–Decoder
that is able to learn the mapping from a sequence
of an arbitrary length to another sequence, possibly from a different set, of an arbitrary length. The
proposed RNN Encoder–Decoder is able to either
score a pair of sequences (in terms of a conditional
probability) or generate a target sequence given a
source sequence. Along with the new architecture,
we proposed a novel hidden unit that includes a reset gate and an update gate that adaptively control
how much each hidden unit remembers or forgets
while reading/generating a sequence.
We evaluated the proposed model with the task
of statistical machine translation, where we used
the RNN Encoder–Decoder to score each phrase
pair in the phrase table. Qualitatively, we were
able to show that the new model is able to capture linguistic regularities in the phrase pairs well
and also that the RNN Encoder–Decoder is able to
propose well-formed target phrases.
The scores by the RNN Encoder–Decoder were
found to improve the overall translation performance in terms of BLEU scores. Also, we
found that the contribution by the RNN Encoder–
Decoder is rather orthogonal to the existing approach of using neural networks in the SMT system, so that we can improve further the performance by using, for instance, the RNN Encoder–
Decoder and the neural net language model together.
Our qualitative analysis of the trained model
shows that it indeed captures the linguistic regularities in multiple levels i.e. at the word level as
well as phrase level. This suggests that there may
be more natural language related applications that
may benefit from the proposed RNN Encoder–
Decoder.
The proposed architecture has large potential
for further improvement and analysis. One approach that was not investigated here is to replace the whole, or a part of the phrase table by
letting the RNN Encoder–Decoder propose target
phrases. Also, noting that the proposed model is
not limited to being used with written language,
it will be an important future research to apply the
proposed architecture to other applications such as
speech transcription.
