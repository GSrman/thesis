Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model called RNN Encoder–
Decoder that consists of two recurrent
neural networks (RNN). One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixedlength vector representation, and the other
decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly
trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source
sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder–Decoder as an
additional feature in the existing log-linear
model. Qualitatively, we show that the
proposed model learns a semantically and
syntactically meaningful representation of
linguistic phrases.
Introduction
Deep neural networks have shown great success in
various applications such as objection recognition
(see, e.g., (Krizhevsky et al., 2012)) and speech
recognition (see, e.g., (Dahl et al., 2012)). Furthermore, many recent works showed that neural networks can be successfully used in a number of tasks in natural language processing (NLP).
These include, but are not limited to, language
modeling (Bengio et al., 2003), paraphrase detection (Socher et al., 2011) and word embedding extraction (Mikolov et al., 2013). In the field of statistical machine translation (SMT), deep neural
networks have begun to show promising results.
(Schwenk, 2012) summarizes a successful usage
of feedforward neural networks in the framework
of phrase-based SMT system.
Along this line of research on using neural networks for SMT, this paper focuses on a novel neural network architecture that can be used as a part
of the conventional phrase-based SMT system.
The proposed neural network architecture, which
we will refer to as an RNN Encoder–Decoder, consists of two recurrent neural networks (RNN) that
act as an encoder and a decoder pair. The encoder maps a variable-length source sequence to a
fixed-length vector, and the decoder maps the vector representation back to a variable-length target
sequence. The two networks are trained jointly to
maximize the conditional probability of the target
sequence given a source sequence. Additionally,
we propose to use a rather sophisticated hidden
unit in order to improve both the memory capacity
and the ease of training.
The proposed RNN Encoder–Decoder with a
novel hidden unit is empirically evaluated on the
task of translating from English to French. We
train the model to learn the translation probability of an English phrase to a corresponding French
phrase. The model is then used as a part of a standard phrase-based SMT system by scoring each
phrase pair in the phrase table. The empirical evaluation reveals that this approach of scoring phrase
pairs with an RNN Encoder–Decoder improves
the translation performance.
We qualitatively analyze the trained RNN
Encoder–Decoder by comparing its phrase scores
with those given by the existing translation model.
The qualitative analysis shows that the RNN
Encoder–Decoder is better at capturing the linguistic regularities in the phrase table, indirectly
explaining the quantitative improvements in the
overall translation performance. The further analysis of the model reveals that the RNN Encoder–
Decoder learns a continuous space representation
of a phrase that preserves both the semantic and
syntactic structure of the phrase.
Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a new neural network
architecture, called an RNN Encoder–Decoder
that is able to learn the mapping from a sequence
of an arbitrary length to another sequence, possibly from a different set, of an arbitrary length. The
proposed RNN Encoder–Decoder is able to either
score a pair of sequences (in terms of a conditional
probability) or generate a target sequence given a
source sequence. Along with the new architecture,
we proposed a novel hidden unit that includes a reset gate and an update gate that adaptively control
how much each hidden unit remembers or forgets
while reading/generating a sequence.
We evaluated the proposed model with the task
of statistical machine translation, where we used
the RNN Encoder–Decoder to score each phrase
pair in the phrase table. Qualitatively, we were
able to show that the new model is able to capture linguistic regularities in the phrase pairs well
and also that the RNN Encoder–Decoder is able to
propose well-formed target phrases.
The scores by the RNN Encoder–Decoder were
found to improve the overall translation performance in terms of BLEU scores. Also, we
found that the contribution by the RNN Encoder–
Decoder is rather orthogonal to the existing approach of using neural networks in the SMT system, so that we can improve further the performance by using, for instance, the RNN Encoder–
Decoder and the neural net language model together.
Our qualitative analysis of the trained model
shows that it indeed captures the linguistic regularities in multiple levels i.e. at the word level as
well as phrase level. This suggests that there may
be more natural language related applications that
may benefit from the proposed RNN Encoder–
Decoder.
The proposed architecture has large potential
for further improvement and analysis. One approach that was not investigated here is to replace the whole, or a part of the phrase table by
letting the RNN Encoder–Decoder propose target
phrases. Also, noting that the proposed model is
not limited to being used with written language,
it will be an important future research to apply the
proposed architecture to other applications such as
speech transcription.

Certainly! Let’s summarize the ethical aspects discussed in the research paper on the RNN Encoder–Decoder model:

Bias and Fairness:
The paper does not explicitly discuss bias and fairness aspects related to the RNN Encoder–Decoder model. However, it’s essential to consider these factors when deploying such models to ensure equitable outcomes.
Privacy:
Privacy implications are not directly addressed in the paper. When implementing RNN Encoder–Decoder models, privacy concerns may arise due to the use of sensitive data. Researchers and practitioners should be cautious about data privacy and anonymization.
Transparency:
The paper does not delve into transparency aspects. Transparency is crucial for understanding model behavior, especially in critical applications. Researchers should document model architecture, hyperparameters, and training details to enhance transparency.
Dual Use:
The paper does not explicitly discuss dual-use scenarios. Dual-use refers to technologies that can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes. Researchers should consider potential misuse and ethical implications.
Accessibility:
Accessibility considerations are not covered in the paper. When deploying models, ensuring accessibility for users with disabilities (e.g., visual impairments) is essential. Providing accessible interfaces and documentation is crucial.
Data Collection:
The paper does not specifically address data collection ethics. Researchers collecting data for training RNN Encoder–Decoder models should follow ethical guidelines, obtain informed consent, and handle sensitive information responsibly.
In summary, while the paper focuses on the technical aspects of the RNN Encoder–Decoder model, ethical considerations play a vital role in its real-world deployment. Researchers and practitioners should proactively address these aspects to build responsible and reliable AI systems12. 🌟

Abstract
We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from
unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both
left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be finetuned with just one additional output layer
to create state-of-the-art models for a wide
range of tasks, such as question answering and
language inference, without substantial taskspecific architecture modifications.
BERT is conceptually simple and empirically
powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing
tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to
80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),
MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute
improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1
(5.1 point absolute improvement).
Introduction
Language model pre-training has been shown to
be effective for improving many natural language
processing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,
2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,
2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as
natural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;
Williams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan
and Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the relationships between sentences by analyzing them
holistically, as well as token-level tasks such as
named entity recognition and question answering,
where models are required to produce fine-grained
output at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and
De Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).
There are two existing strategies for applying pre-trained language representations to downstream tasks: feature-based and fine-tuning. The
feature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters
et al., 2018a), uses task-specific architectures that
include the pre-trained representations as additional features. The fine-tuning approach, such as
the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI
GPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal
task-specific parameters, and is trained on the
downstream tasks by simply fine-tuning all pretrained parameters. The two approaches share the
same objective function during pre-training, where
they use unidirectional language models to learn
general language representations.
We argue that current techniques restrict the
power of the pre-trained representations, especially for the fine-tuning approaches. The major limitation is that standard language models are
unidirectional, and this limits the choice of architectures that can be used during pre-training. For
example, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-toright architecture, where every token can only attend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers
of the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such restrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,
and could be very harmful when applying finetuning based approaches to token-level tasks such
as question answering, where it is crucial to incorporate context from both directions.
In this paper, we improve the fine-tuning based
approaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional
Encoder Representations from Transformers.
BERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidirectionality constraint by using a “masked language model” (MLM) pre-training objective, inspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The
masked language model randomly masks some of
the tokens from the input, and the objective is to
predict the original vocabulary id of the masked
4172
word based only on its context. Unlike left-toright language model pre-training, the MLM objective enables the representation to fuse the left
and the right context, which allows us to pretrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addition to the masked language model, we also use
a “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pretrains text-pair representations. The contributions
of our paper are as follows:
• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional
pre-training for language representations. Unlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirectional language models for pre-training, BERT
uses masked language models to enable pretrained deep bidirectional representations. This
is also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which
uses a shallow concatenation of independently
trained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.
• We show that pre-trained representations reduce
the need for many heavily-engineered taskspecific architectures. BERT is the first finetuning based representation model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance on a large suite
of sentence-level and token-level tasks, outperforming many task-specific architectures.
• BERT advances the state of the art for eleven
NLP tasks. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/
google-research/bert.
Conclusion
Recent empirical improvements due to transfer
learning with language models have demonstrated
that rich, unsupervised pre-training is an integral
part of many language understanding systems. In
particular, these results enable even low-resource
tasks to benefit from deep unidirectional architectures. Our major contribution is further generalizing these findings to deep bidirectional architectures, allowing the same pre-trained model to successfully tackle a broad set of NLP tasks.
