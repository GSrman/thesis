Abstract
This paper shows that pretraining multilingual
language models at scale leads to significant
performance gains for a wide range of crosslingual transfer tasks. We train a Transformerbased masked language model on one hundred
languages, using more than two terabytes of filtered CommonCrawl data. Our model, dubbed
XLM-R, significantly outperforms multilingual
BERT (mBERT) on a variety of cross-lingual
benchmarks, including +14.6% average accuracy on XNLI, +13% average F1 score on
MLQA, and +2.4% F1 score on NER. XLM-R
performs particularly well on low-resource languages, improving 15.7% in XNLI accuracy
for Swahili and 11.4% for Urdu over previous XLM models. We also present a detailed
empirical analysis of the key factors that are
required to achieve these gains, including the
trade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high
and low resource languages at scale. Finally,
we show, for the first time, the possibility of
multilingual modeling without sacrificing perlanguage performance; XLM-R is very competitive with strong monolingual models on the
GLUE and XNLI benchmarks. We will make
our code, data and models publicly available.1
 Introduction
The goal of this paper is to improve cross-lingual
language understanding (XLU), by carefully studying the effects of training unsupervised crosslingual representations at a very large scale. We
present XLM-R a transformer-based multilingual
masked language model pre-trained on text in 100
languages, which obtains state-of-the-art performance on cross-lingual classification, sequence labeling and question answering.

Multilingual masked language models (MLM)
like mBERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and XLM (Lample and Conneau, 2019) have pushed the stateof-the-art on cross-lingual understanding tasks
by jointly pretraining large Transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017) on many languages.
These models allow for effective cross-lingual
transfer, as seen in a number of benchmarks including cross-lingual natural language inference
(Bowman et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2017; Conneau et al., 2018), question answering (Rajpurkar
et al., 2016; Lewis et al., 2019), and named entity recognition (Pires et al., 2019; Wu and Dredze,
2019). However, all of these studies pre-train on
Wikipedia, which provides a relatively limited scale
especially for lower resource languages.
In this paper, we first present a comprehensive
analysis of the trade-offs and limitations of multilingual language models at scale, inspired by recent monolingual scaling efforts (Liu et al., 2019).
We measure the trade-off between high-resource
and low-resource languages and the impact of language sampling and vocabulary size. The experiments expose a trade-off as we scale the number
of languages for a fixed model capacity: more languages leads to better cross-lingual performance
on low-resource languages up until a point, after
which the overall performance on monolingual and
cross-lingual benchmarks degrades. We refer to
this tradeoff as the curse of multilinguality, and
show that it can be alleviated by simply increasing model capacity. We argue, however, that this
remains an important limitation for future XLU
systems which may aim to improve performance
with more modest computational budgets.
Our best model XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R) outperforms mBERT on cross-lingual classification by
up to 23% accuracy on low-resource languages. It
outperforms the previous state of the art by 5.1% average accuracy on XNLI, 2.42% average F1-score
on Named Entity Recognition, and 9.1% average
F1-score on cross-lingual Question Answering. We
also evaluate monolingual fine tuning on the GLUE
and XNLI benchmarks, where XLM-R obtains results competitive with state-of-the-art monolingual
models, including RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019).
These results demonstrate, for the first time, that
it is possible to have a single large model for all
languages, without sacrificing per-language performance. We will make our code, models and data
publicly available, with the hope that this will help
research in multilingual NLP and low-resource language understanding.
Conclusion
In this work, we introduced XLM-R, our new state
of the art multilingual masked language model
trained on 2.5 TB of newly created clean CommonCrawl data in 100 languages. We show that it
provides strong gains over previous multilingual
models like mBERT and XLM on classification,
sequence labeling and question answering. We exposed the limitations of multilingual MLMs, in
particular by uncovering the high-resource versus
low-resource trade-off, the curse of multilinguality
and the importance of key hyperparameters. We
also expose the surprising effectiveness of multilingual models over monolingual models, and show
strong improvements on low-resource languages.

Abstract
In many languages, sparse availability of resources causes numerous challenges for textual analysis tasks. Text classification is one of
such standard tasks that is hindered due to limited availability of label information in lowresource languages. Transferring knowledge
(i.e. label information) from high-resource to
low-resource languages might improve text
classification as compared to the other approaches like machine translation. We introduce BRAVE (Bilingual paRAgraph VEctors),
a model to learn bilingual distributed representations (i.e. embeddings) of words without word alignments either from sentencealigned parallel or label-aligned non-parallel
document corpora to support cross-language
text classification. Empirical analysis shows
that classification models trained with our
bilingual embeddings outperforms other stateof-the-art systems on three different crosslanguage text classification tasks.
 Introduction
The availability of language-specific annotated resources is crucial for the efficiency of natural language processing tasks. Still, many languages lack
rich annotated resources that support various tasks
such as part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing
and text classification. While the growth of multilingual information on the web has provided an opportunity to build these missing annotated resources,
but still lots of manual effort is required to achieve
high quality resources for every language separately.
Another possibility is to utilize the unlabeled
data present in those languages or transfer knowledge from annotation-rich languages. For the
first alternative, recent advancements made in
learning monolingual distributed representations of
words (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Pennington et al.,
2014; Levy and Goldberg, 2014) (i.e. monolingual word embeddings) capturing syntactic and semantic information in an unsupervised manner was
useful in numerous NLP tasks (Collobert et al.,
2011). However, this may not be sufficient for
several other tasks such as cross-language information retrieval (Grefenstette, 2012), cross-language
word semantic similarity (Vulic and Moens, 2014), ¬¥
cross-language text classification (CLTC, henceforth) (Klementiev et al., 2012; Xiao and Guo, 2013;
Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010; Tang and Wan, 2014)
and machine translation (Zhao et al., 2015) due to
irregularities across languages. In these kind of scenarios, transfer of knowledge can be useful.
Several approaches (Hermann and Blunsom,
2014; Sarath Chandar et al., 2014; Gouws et al.,
2015; Coulmance et al., 2015) tried to induce
monolingual distributed representations into a language independent space (i.e. bilingual or multilingual word embeddings) by jointly training on pair
of languages. Although the overall goal of these
approaches is to capture linguistic regularities in
words that share same semantic and syntactic space
across languages, they differ in their implementation. One set of methods either perform offline
alignment of trained monolingual embeddings or
jointly-train both monolingual and cross-lingual objectives, while the other set uses only cross-lingual
objective. Jointly-trained or offline alignment methods can be further divided based on the type of par-
allel corpus (e.g. word-aligned, sentence-aligned)
they use for learning the cross-lingual objective. Table 1 summarizes different setups to learn bilingual
or multilingual embeddings for the various tasks.
Methods in the Table 1 that use word-aligned
parallel corpus as offline alignment (Mikolov et
al., 2013b; Faruqui and Dyer, 2014) assume single correspondence between the words across languages and ignore polysemy. While, the jointlytrain methods (Klementiev et al., 2012) that use
word-alignment parallel corpus and consider polysemy perform computationally expensive operation
of considering all possible interactions between the
pairs of words in vocabulary of two different languages. Methods (Hermann and Blunsom, 2014;
Sarath Chandar et al., 2014) that overcame the
complexity issues of word-aligned models by using sentence-aligned parallel corpora limits themselves to only cross-lingual objective, thus making these approaches unable to explore monolingual corpora. Jointly-trained models (Gouws et al.,
2015; Coulmance et al., 2015) overcame the issues
of both word-aligned and purely cross-lingual objective models by using monolingual and sentencealigned parallel corpora. Nonetheless, these approaches still have certain drawbacks such as usage of only bag-of-words from the parallel sentences ignoring order of words. Thus, they are
missing to capture the non-compositional meaning
of entire sentence. Also, learned bilingual embeddings were heavily biased towards the sampled
sentence-aligned parallel corpora. It is also sometimes hard to acquire sentence-level parallel corpora
for every language pair. To subdue this concern,
few approaches (Rajendran et al., 2015) used pivot
languages like English or comparable documentaligned corpora (Vulic and Moens, 2015) to learn ¬¥
bilingual embeddings specific to only one task.
This major downside can be observed in other
aforementioned methods also, which are inflexible
to handle different types of parallel corpora and
have a tight-binding between cross-lingual objectives and the parallel corpora. For example, a
method using sentence-level parallel corpora cannot be altered to leverage document-level parallel
corpora (if available) that might have better performance for some tasks. Also, none of the approaches do leverage widely available label/classaligned non-parallel documents (e.g. sentiment labels, multi-class datasets) across languages which
share special semantics such as sentiment or correlation between concepts as opposed to parallel texts.
In this paper, we introduce BRAVE a jointlytrained flexible model that learns bilingual embeddings based on the availability of the type of corpora (e.g. sentence-aligned parallel or label/classaligned non-parallel document) by just altering the
cross-lingual objective. BRAVE leverages paragraph vector embeddings (Le and Mikolov, 2014)
of the monolingual corpora to effectively conceal
semantics of the text sequences across languages
and build a cross-lingual objective. Method closely
related to our approach is by Pham et al. (2015)
who uses shared context sentence vector across lan-
guages to learn multilingual text sequences.
The main contributions of this paper are:
‚Ä¢ We jointly train monolingual part of parallel
corpora with the improved cross-lingual alignment function that extends beyond bag-of-word
models.
‚Ä¢ Introduced a novel approach to leverage nonparallel data sets such as label or class aligned
documents in different languages for learning
bilingual cues.
‚Ä¢ Experimental evaluation on three different
CLTC tasks, namely cross-language document classification, multi-label classification
and cross-language sentiment classification using learned bilingual word embeddings.
Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we presented an approach that leverages paragraph vectors to learn bilingual word embeddings with sentence-aligned parallel and labelaligned non-parallel corpora. Empirical analysis exhibited that embeddings learned from both of these
types of corpora have shown good impact on CLTC
tasks. In future, we aim to extend the approach
to learn multilingual semantic spaces with more labels/classes.
