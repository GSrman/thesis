1. Ethical Considerations:
   - Bias and Fairness: The methods introduced must ensure fair representation of languages without any bias
towards high-resource or low-resource languages.
   - Privacy: Any shared data used for training should be anonymized to protect user privacy, especially when
dealing with label or class aligned non-parallel document corpora in different languages.

2. Ethical Considerations:
   - Dual Use: Researchers must consider the potential dual use of bilingual word embeddings and ensure that they
are not used for malicious purposes such as creating biased algorithms or misinformation campaigns.

3. Ethical Considerations:
   - Accessibility: The research should strive to make advancements in text classification accessible across
different languages, especially those with less representation, to promote inclusivity and diversity.

4. Transparency: Researchers must provide clear documentation about the data sources, methods used, potential
biases, and limitations of their models to ensure transparency and reproducibinas ethical research practices.
