**Bias and Fairness:** The abstract does not specifically mention bias
or fairness in relation to BERT. However, by providing rich language
representations that can be applied across various tasks without
task-specific modifications, it indirectly promotes fairness by
allowing models trained on diverse datasets to perform well.

**Privacy:** The paper abstract does not discuss privacy aspects of
the BERT model or its applications in any detail.

**Transparency:** While transparency isn't directly addressed, the
availability of code and pre-trained models at
https://github.com/google-research/bert suggests a level of openness
in research.

**Dual Use:** There is no direct discussion about dual use in this
paper's abstract; however, BERT's widespread application to various
NLP tasks could potentially raise concerns regarding misuse.

**Accessibility:** The accessibility aspect isn't explicitly discussed
here but can be inferred from the availability of resources (GitHub
link), suggesting that researchers and practitioners have an
accessible entry point for utilizing BERT.

**Data Collection:** The paper abstract does not provide details on
data collection practices or methodologies, which are critical in
assessing bias.
