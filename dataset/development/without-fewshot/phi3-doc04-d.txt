The document discusses the potential biases and challenges in large
language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and their implications on various
aspects like energy usage, generation of news articles, societal
impacts, and fairness. It also presents an experiment demonstrating
that humans struggle to distinguish between model generated articles
and human written articles, especially when the article size increases
from 200 words to around 569 words with GPT-3 175B. This difficulty in
discrimination suggests a challenge in ensinasing societal impacts of
these models at scale due to their ability to generate realistic
content that is difficult for humans to distinguish as machine
generated.
